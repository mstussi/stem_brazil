STEM Classification of CBO-2002 Occupations and Brazillian HEC Fields of Education

We provide .csv tables classifying CBO-2002 occupations (Classificação Brasileira de Ocupações) into STEM and non-STEM occupations, as well as INEP’s
HEC's(Higher Education Census) fields of education classification of STEM degrees in Brazil. In addition to the tables, we also provide reports in .pdf format with a guide and full disclosure of the classification processes.
