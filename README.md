<b> <h3> STEM Classification of CBO-2002 Occupations and Brazillian HEC Fields of Education </h3> </b>

We provide .csv tables classifying CBO-2002 occupations (Classificação Brasileira de Ocupações) into STEM and non-STEM occupations, as well as INEP’s
HEC's(Higher Education Census) fields of education classification of STEM degrees in Brazil. In addition to the tables, we also provide reports in .pdf format with a guide and full disclosure of the classification processes. 

In Brazil, there is no official taxonomy of STEM jobs or educational fields. As a result, the few existing analysis of STEM jobs and education in Brazil use their own, generally vague, classifications and are not transparent about the classification criteria. We seek to fill this gap in the STEM taxonomy and literature by providing unprecedented classification of STEM occupations and higher-education degrees in Brazil.

<i> About the occupational and educational degrees standards: </i>

[CBO](https://concla.ibge.gov.br/classificacoes/por-tema/ocupacao/classificacao-brasileira-de-ocupacoes.html) (Classificação Brasileira de Ocupações)  is the Brazilian statistical standard to classify workers into occupational categories. It describes and orders occupations within a hierarchical structure that makes it possible to aggregate information regarding the workforce, according to occupational characteristics that concern the nature of the workforce and the content of the work. We classify STEM occupations based on [a definition](https://www.bls.gov/soc/attachment_c_stem.pdf) proposed by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (USBLS) for the [2010-SOC](https://www.bls.gov/soc/2010/home.htm) (Standard Occupational Classification). For each of the 622 CBO-2002 four-digit occupational codes, a correspondence was sought among the SOC-2010 set of 97 STEM occupations listed by USBLS.
